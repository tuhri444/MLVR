GENERAL INFO:

DataSet folder is the container for each folder holding its symbol. 
It currently contains some example folders with the name of the symbol that it is holding.

output folder contains the .onnx file that is needed in Unity to use as model.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 0 - get winrar and decompress all the main.partx.rar and move the resulting main.exe into the base folder.

Step 1 - Make sure the images have a size of 64x64 as pngs.(powertoys is a nice piece of software that
allows you to mass-resize images.)

Step 2 - Each image of a certain symbol should be wrapped into a folder with the name of that symbol and
then put inside of the DataSet folder. (It is recommended to have atleast 200+ images of a single symbol.)

Step 3 - Run Main.exe (wait some time to load it) and vuala! 

Step 4 - check out the output folder, it contains the .onnx file that you can import straight into unity.
